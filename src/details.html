        connect with peers facing similar challenges, and navigate the complexities of hero training with the
        encouragement of their fellow dorm residents.
        Teachers are always available to help with every individual student and their needs. These teachers are also
        professional heroes and have beyond normal capabilities of normal high school teachers.</h3>

        well-rounded and resilient heroes. It goes beyond accommodation, creating an immersive and supportive living
